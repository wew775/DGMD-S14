1. Team Name: Far East Heads

2. Team Members and Roles: (Depending on the strengths of each member as an example)
Zhengyuan Liu: coding and classification
Wei Wen: Data collection and training

3. Goal of the Project: (Describe here which problem are you solving and your motivation)
As working professional we all have chronic neck problem. I have constant neck spasm and have to use swimming to solve
the problem. However swimming is a time consuming exercise, and it would be great if we have a wearable device that can guide through a
set of exercise related to head movements. In order to do so we need to classify different head movements first, and this is the goal of
our project.

The deliverable of our project will be a program that classifies head movements. We will not include the guided exercise part as we think the hard part is how to
recognize different head movement and that the device know whether you are performing the right movement. We will not design the actual exercise as it is a topic
related to kinesiology.

4. Software and Developing tools:
- Anaconda
- Atom
- Eclipse
- Github Desktop
- FANN (for machine learning)
- Jupyter Notebook

    a. include a GitHub repository
    https://github.com/wew775/DGMD-S14

    b. any other tools? (example: dropbox, google drive, slack, google collab, etc.)
    Our explanatory documents will be shared through email primarily as google might not be convenient based on our location.

5. Hardware used:
- STMicro Sensortile and nucleo board
- possibly cell phone
- possibly raspberry pi.

6. Team Meeting Schedule: (tentative hours to meet with your team every week)
We will meet every Thursday night at 7:30.

7. List of Milestones, week by week:

Example:

Week 1. Setting up a laptop, developing environment, build a device, operate the device.

Week 2. Finish all tutorials

Week 3. Finish all tutorials including machine learning (tutorial 9 - 13)

Week 4. Finish sensortile coding, flash our data collection program into sensortile

Week 5. Start collecting data

Week 6. write a classifier program to classify different head movements and flash onto sensortile.

Week 7. Finish write up and presentation

8. Other comments:
We are fairly new to computer programming and this is our first hardware course. It would be great if there's additional
resource and textbook instructions that we can follow to understand better.
